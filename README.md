## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JSON
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned a lot of things with this project, like custom properties, how to use variables in CSS, utility classes, resets... 
Also learned great skills for better responsiveness, how to use a JSON file, and practice more my Javascript, accessibility, and more...
It would take too much time to list all the things I learned in this project. I followed the Scrimba course, and I tried to do as many things as possible by myself, I chose to use the JSON file because it was a more interesting challenge for me.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to use variables and utility classes in my CSS, and progress further with JavaScript, GRID etc...

### Useful resources

- [https://www.scrimba.com] - Use it for the course, and all the tips.
- [https://www.w3schools.com] - Use it for some searches and reminders.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ] - Use for some information about JSON, and how to make images responsive using JavaScript.
